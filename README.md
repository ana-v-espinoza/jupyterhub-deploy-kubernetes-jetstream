# Deploy JupyterHub on top of Kubernetes on Jetstream

Configuration files for the tutorials available on my blog <https://zonca.dev/categories/#jetstream>

The recommended deployment strategy is via Magnum, see the [tutorial](https://zonca.dev/2019/06/kubernetes-jupyterhub-jetstream-magnum.html), which also supports autoscaling, see the [autoscaling tutorial](https://zonca.dev/2019/09/kubernetes-jetstream-autoscaler.html).

The other option, which provides a most customizable setup but which is longer to deploy and does not support autoscaling, is via Kubespray, see the [deployment with Kubespray tutorial](https://zonca.dev/2020/06/kubernetes-jetstream-kubespray.html).
